# glostis' dotfiles

This repository holds my dotfiles, which are managed by [`chezmoi`](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

To get started on a new machine, run:

```
chezmoi init https://github.com/glostis/dotfiles.git
```

Then, to check the changes that would be applied by `chezmoi`, run:

chezmoi diff
```

If you're happy with the changes, run:

```

```
